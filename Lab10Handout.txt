STUDENT HANDOUT: Perfect Maze Generation Using Kruskal’s Algorithm

Lab: Perfect Maze Generation Using Kruskal’s Algorithm

Overview
In this lab, you will generate a perfect maze — a maze with exactly one simple path between any two cells — by computing a minimum spanning tree (MST) of a grid graph using Kruskal’s Algorithm.

This lab emphasizes algorithmic reasoning:
- Modeling a 2D grid as a graph
- Generating weighted edges
- Using union–find to detect cycles
- Running Kruskal’s MST algorithm
- Converting the MST into a maze

Example 5×5 Maze:
###########
#.#...#.#.#
#.#.###.#.#
#.........#
#.#.###.###
#.#.#...#.#
#.###.#.#.#
#...#.#.#.#
#####.#.#.#
#.....#...#
###########

Example valid path (top-left to bottom-right, using only up/down/left/right):
Down, Right, Right, Right, Right, Down, Down, Down, Right, Right
